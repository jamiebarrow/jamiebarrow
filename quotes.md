# Quotes

Below is a list of some of my favourite quotes that I've seen or read.

> La patience est am√®re, mais son fruit est doux.<br>
> -- <cite>[Jean-Jacques Rousseau][1]</cite>

> The winters won't change, but you can.<br>
> And that's how life changes for you<br>
> -- <cite>[Jim Rohn][2]</cite>

> Success is the product of daily habits -<br>
> not once-in-a-lifetime transformations<br>
> -- <cite>[James Clear][3]</cite>

> <br>
> There's a saying:<br>
> <br>
