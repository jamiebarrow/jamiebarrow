# PARA Method

I came across the [PARA Method][2] while enjoying a video by [Mischa van den Burg][3] on the [Zettelkasten][1] note taking system.

PARA is a mnemonic for Projects, Areas, Resources and an Archive.
The PARA Method is about organizing things based on these categories.
Some people also include an Inbox where everything is first collected before organizing, I name this Collect.

- Collect
    - inbox where things are put into a stack of notes for later organizing
- Projects
    - set of folders for each project that is currently in progress
    - e.g. Project: Wedding Planning
- Areas
    - stores collections of related artifacts for a long-term or indefinite time period, such as areas in your life
    - e.g. Area: Finance
- Resources
    - items that are for reference for ongoing projects and areas
- Archive
    - anything from the above which are no longer relevant
    - prefer archiving over deleting as they may later become relevant
