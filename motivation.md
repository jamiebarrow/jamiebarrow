# Motivation

Life can be hard at times.


A forever powerful and inspiring seminar is that of Jim Rohn
- [How to Have the Best Year Ever! - Personal Development Life Coaching](https://youtu.be/6QVOBsS6ECY), Jim Rohn, YouTube

His wisdom is also available on Audible:
- [The Ultimate Jim Rohn Library](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Ultimate-Jim-Rohn-Library-Audiobook/B076PSG3MV), Jim Rohn, Audible

One of my most favourites that he shares is around the four major lessons in life to learn, and around the changing seasons of life:
- [Life Is Like The Changing Seasons (Part 1) - Powerful Motivation Video](https://youtu.be/QU333LmZ4CE), Jim Rohn, YouTube

Narrated by the man himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger, this audiobook was surprisingly a great listen, highly recommended:
- [Be Useful: Seven Tools for Life](https://www.audible.com/pd/Be-Useful-Audiobook/B0C2HRWCWM), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Audible

Inspiration can also at times be found in some of my favourite [quotes](quotes.md).

For the times that it is difficult to replace bad behaviours with good behaviours and habits, try the techniques summarized in [this video](https://youtu.be/PZ7lDrwYdZc) for the book [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear.
